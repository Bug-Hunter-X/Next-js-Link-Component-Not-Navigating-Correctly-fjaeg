# Next.js Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the Next.js Link component where it fails to navigate to the specified route.  The component renders correctly, but clicking the link does not trigger the expected page transition. 

## Bug Description

The `Link` component, despite having a valid `href` attribute, does not redirect to the '/about' page. The issue is not related to routing configuration or missing pages.  The behavior is inconsistent and hard to debug.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that clicking the 'About Us' link does not navigate to the about page.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Link component is used correctly and that there are no conflicting elements or configurations affecting the routing process.  Sometimes, issues with the application structure or dynamic routes cause similar problems. The solution might involve simplifying the structure or adding more logging to identify the source of the issue.
